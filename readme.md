## About The App
To Do -sovellus is an app that stores user input in the browser's local storage and compiles a to do list of the user's input. Added tasks can be checkmarked to indicate they've been complete. Tasks can also be removed from the list.

## Technologies
HTML - to make the app visible in browser.
CSS - to style the app window.
JavaScript - to add dynamic functionality to the app.

## Setup
Write brief instructions on how to run and use your app. For example:
- Navigate to 
- Click the 'Lis채채 teht채v채' field to write a task
- Click the + button on the side
- Checkmark a task when you've completed it!
- Remove a task from the list by clicking the 'X' button.
- Your tasks are stored in the browser's local storage - close the browser and return later to see your tasks again.

## Status
To Do -sovellus is considered 'potentially finished'. As my first JavaScript project I'd like to improve upon it, but I might just rewrite the whole code at a later date, as I'm not super happy with how it turned out. As of now the code is quite hard to edit.
